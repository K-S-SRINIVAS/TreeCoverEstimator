# Tree Cover Estimator

This project detects trees from satellite images using a deep learning model and calculates the total tree cover area.  
It provides a simple interface to visualize detected trees and understand green cover in a selected area.

## Project Overview
The application combines a Python backend (with a U-Net based deep learning model) and a React frontend.  
Users can upload or select an area from satellite images, and the system detects trees and computes the overall tree cover percentage.

## Features
- Detects trees from satellite images using a trained model.
- Calculates total tree cover area/percentage.
- Interactive visualization of detected trees on the map.

## How to Run
- Start the backend from the `Backend` folder.
- Start the frontend from the `Frontend` folder.
